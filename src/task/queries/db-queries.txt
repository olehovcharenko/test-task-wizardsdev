// Queries for endpoints


//
a) Count of each city members sorted by count DESC.
SELECT c.name AS city, COUNT(r.id) AS count
FROM Cities c
JOIN Residents r ON r.city_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY count DESC;

b) Count of members with the same first_name by every city.

SELECT c.name AS city, r.first_name, COUNT(r.id) AS count
FROM Cities c
JOIN Residents r ON r.city_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.name, r.first_name;


c) Filter by “city” field partial coincidence.

SELECT c.name AS city, COUNT(r.id) AS count
FROM Cities c
JOIN Residents r ON r.city_id = c.id
WHERE c.name LIKE '%partial_name%'
GROUP BY c.name;
